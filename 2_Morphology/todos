ToDos

- install transducer from https://github.com/santhoshtr/sfst and test with a small lexicon file

- 2 lexicon files (verb, noun) with a lemma per line (3*5 total lemmas): Leah

- code to recognize different forms of a given word (input). sample implementation below. see slide 44-45

    > fst-compiler-utf8 morph.fst morph.a
    > fst-mor morph.a
    analyze> lobbies
    lobby<N><pl>

    analyze> stores
    store<N><pl>
    analyze> houses
    house<N><pl>
    analyze>

    generate> house<N><pl>
    houses
    generate> house<N><sg>
    house

    Note: in 'analyze' mode, the transducer runs backwards (end to start). 'lobby' <- 'lobbies', 'store' <- 'stores'

    - possible steps:
       - start working with code from 44 (if input is 'lobbies', map
